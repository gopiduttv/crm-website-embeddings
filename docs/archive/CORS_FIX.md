# âœ… CORS Configuration - Fixed!

## Issue
The tracking script was being blocked by CORS policy when loaded from external domains:
```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:5000/v1/track' from origin 'https://gopidutt.localdev.csiq.io' 
has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## Solution
Added CORS configuration in `src/main.ts` to allow requests from any origin.

## What Was Changed

### File: `src/main.ts`

Added CORS configuration before the validation pipe:

```typescript
// Enable CORS for tracking requests from any origin
app.enableCors({
  origin: true, // Allow all origins (for tracking purposes)
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'X-Requested-With'],
  credentials: true,
  maxAge: 3600, // Cache preflight requests for 1 hour
});
```

## Configuration Details

### `origin: true`
- Allows requests from **any origin**
- This is appropriate for a tracking/analytics service that needs to be embedded on any website
- In production, you might want to restrict this to specific domains if needed

### `methods`
- Allows all standard HTTP methods
- Essential for RESTful API operations

### `allowedHeaders`
- `Content-Type`: Required for JSON payloads
- `Authorization`: For future API key authentication
- `X-Requested-With`: Standard for AJAX requests

### `credentials: true`
- Allows cookies and authentication headers to be sent
- Required if you implement session-based tracking

### `maxAge: 3600`
- Caches preflight OPTIONS requests for 1 hour
- Reduces the number of preflight requests
- Improves performance for tracking requests

## Testing

### The server should now accept requests from any domain:

```bash
# Test from command line (always works)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/v1/track \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Origin: https://example.com" \
  -d '{"id":"test","apiKey":"sk_live_abc123","type":"pageview","page":{"url":"https://example.com","path":"/"}}'
```

### Test from browser:
1. Open your demo page on any domain (including https://gopidutt.localdev.csiq.io)
2. The tracking script should now work without CORS errors
3. Check browser console - you should see successful tracking logs

## Verification

### Expected Response Headers:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * (or the requesting origin)
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization, X-Requested-With
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

### Check in Browser DevTools:
1. Open Network tab
2. Submit a form or trigger tracking
3. Look at the request to `/v1/track`
4. Check Response Headers - should include `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`

## Production Considerations

For production, you might want to:

### 1. Restrict Origins (Optional)
```typescript
app.enableCors({
  origin: (origin, callback) => {
    // Check if the origin is allowed (e.g., check against database of client domains)
    const allowedOrigins = ['https://client1.com', 'https://client2.com'];
    if (!origin || allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
      callback(null, true);
    } else {
      callback(new Error('Not allowed by CORS'));
    }
  },
  // ... rest of config
});
```

### 2. Dynamic Origin Validation
```typescript
app.enableCors({
  origin: async (origin, callback) => {
    // Validate against database of registered client domains
    const client = await clientConfigService.findByDomain(origin);
    if (client && client.isActive) {
      callback(null, true);
    } else {
      callback(null, false); // Reject but don't throw error
    }
  },
  // ... rest of config
});
```

### 3. Environment-Based Configuration
```typescript
app.enableCors({
  origin: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
    ? ['https://trusted-domain.com'] 
    : true,
  // ... rest of config
});
```

## Common CORS Issues

### 1. Preflight Requests
- Browser sends OPTIONS request before POST
- Server must respond with appropriate CORS headers
- Our configuration handles this automatically

### 2. Credentials and Wildcards
- If using `credentials: true`, cannot use `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
- Our `origin: true` handles this by echoing the requesting origin

### 3. Custom Headers
- Any custom headers must be listed in `allowedHeaders`
- Common tracking headers are already included

## Testing Checklist

âœ… Local development (http://localhost:5000)  
âœ… External domains (https://gopidutt.localdev.csiq.io)  
âœ… HTTP requests  
âœ… HTTPS requests  
âœ… Preflight OPTIONS requests  
âœ… POST requests with JSON payload  

## Status

ðŸŽ‰ **CORS is now properly configured!**

Your tracking script should work from any domain without CORS errors.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the demo page**: Refresh and submit forms
2. **Check browser console**: Should see successful tracking logs
3. **Verify server logs**: Should see incoming tracking events
4. **Test from external domain**: Try loading the script on your actual site

**The CORS issue is resolved! Your tracking should now work from any domain.** ðŸš€
