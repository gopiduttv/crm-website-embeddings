# CRM Web Tracker - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Last Updated**: October 22, 2025  
**Version**: 2.0  
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 In Progress

---

## 1. Product Overview

### Vision
A lightweight, easy-to-integrate CRM tracking solution that enables businesses to manually configure website forms, map fields to CRM properties, and automatically track lead-generating events‚Äîcapturing complete and partial leads without complex integrations.

### Core Value Proposition
- **Zero Configuration Setup**: Single script tag integration with bootloader pattern
- **Lead-Focused Tracking**: Only tracks events that generate leads (forms, interactions, chat)
- **Partial Lead Capture**: Captures abandoned forms with email for follow-up
- **Manual Form Configuration**: Simple interface to define forms and their fields
- **Flexible Field Mapping**: Configure how form fields map to CRM properties
- **Real-time Lead Capture**: Automatic capture of complete and partial leads
- **Privacy-First**: Automatic redaction of sensitive fields (password, SSN, credit card)
- **High Performance**: Batch processing with 10k+ events/sec throughput
- **Scalable Architecture**: Hybrid database design optimized for both config and event data

### Problem Statement
Businesses lose 70-80% of potential leads from form abandonment. Current solutions either:
1. Require complex integrations with each form
2. Don't capture partial/abandoned form data
3. Track too much noise (page views, clicks) without actionable lead data

### Solution
A lead-focused tracking system that captures:
- **Complete leads** from form submissions
- **Partial leads** from abandoned forms (if email is captured)
- **Conversational leads** from chat interactions
- Nothing else (no page views, no generic clicks)

### 3.5 Lead-Focused Event Tracking

**Feature**: Real-time capture of lead-generating events only

**User Stories**:
- As a marketing manager, I want to capture complete form submissions as high-quality leads
- As a marketing manager, I want to capture abandoned forms with email as partial leads for follow-up
- As a sales manager, I want to see lead quality scores to prioritize follow-up

**Tracking Strategy**:
The system focuses exclusively on events that generate leads, eliminating noise from generic analytics.

**Events Tracked**:

| Event Type | Purpose | Lead Created | Quality | Priority |
|------------|---------|--------------|---------|----------|
| `form_submission` | Complete form data | ‚úÖ Always | High | üî¥ Critical |
| `form_interaction` | Partial form data (blur, beforeunload, change) | üü° If email present | Medium | üî¥ Critical |
| `chat_message_sent` | Chat conversations | ‚úÖ If email collected | High | üü° Medium |
| `tracker_initialized` | System validation | ‚ùå Never | N/A | üü¢ Low |

**Events NOT Tracked** (no lead value):
- ‚ùå Page views
- ‚ùå Generic clicks
- ‚ùå Link clicks
- ‚ùå Scroll depth
- ‚ùå Time on page

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Automatic tracking of all configured forms
- [x] Form field interaction tracking (blur, beforeunload, change events)
- [x] Capture partial leads from abandoned forms
- [x] Send data to CRM in real-time (< 5s latency)
- [x] Event batching and queue management
- [x] Redact sensitive fields (password, credit card, SSN, CVV, PIN)
- [ ] Deduplicate submissions (same visitor + form within 24h)
- [x] Associate events with user session/visitor ID
- [x] Lead quality scoring (high/medium/low)

**Lead Creation Logic**:

| Event | Condition | Lead Status | Quality | Follow-up |
|-------|-----------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Form Submission | Any submission | `submitted` | `high` | Immediate contact |
| Form Interaction (blur) | Email field filled | `partial` | `medium` | Follow-up email: "We noticed you started..." |
| Form Interaction (beforeunload) | Email in any field | `partial` | `medium` | Follow-up email: "Finish your request..." |
| Chat Message | Email collected | `chat_inquiry` | `high` | Live chat response |

**Privacy & Compliance**:
- Automatically redact sensitive fields:
  - `password`, `confirm_password`
  - `ssn`, `social_security`
  - `credit_card`, `card_number`, `cvv`, `cvc`
  - `pin`, `security_code`
- GDPR-compliant data storage
- Right to deletion support
- Cookie consent integration

## 7. Open Questions & Decisions

### Questions to Resolve

1. **CRM Integration Priority**

   - Real-time vs batch sync?
   - **Decision needed by**: November 15, 2025

2. **Pricing Model**
   - Per site, per submission, or per feature?
   - Tiered pricing vs flat rate?
   - Free tier limits?
   - **Decision needed by**: December 1, 2025

3. **Data Residency**
   - Where to store tracked data? (US, EU, multi-region)
   - GDPR compliance requirements?
   - Data retention default (90 days, 1 year, forever)?
   - **Decision needed by**: November 30, 2025

4. **Form Changes**
   - How to notify users when forms change on their website?
   - Automatic re-detection vs manual update?
   - **Decision needed by**: Phase 3 planning

5. **Field Selector Helper**
   - Build browser extension or iframe-based tool?
   - Chrome extension vs cross-browser?
   - **Decision needed by**: Phase 2 planning

### Design Decisions Made

‚úÖ **Lead-Focused Tracking**: Only track events that generate leads (no page views, clicks)  
‚úÖ **Manual Form Configuration**: Users define forms manually (vs automatic discovery)  
‚úÖ **Event Batching**: Batch events for performance (5s flush interval)  
‚úÖ **Privacy-First**: Automatically redact sensitive fields  
‚úÖ **Real-time Capture**: Use `beforeunload` to capture abandoned forms  

### Design Decisions Pending

üü° **Multiple Selectors per Field**: Support fallback selectors for resilience?  
üü° **Real-time vs Batch Processing**: For CRM sync, use real-time or batch?  
üü° **Self-hosted vs Cloud-only**: Support on-premise deployment?  
üü° **Lead Deduplication**: Deduplicate by email only or email + sessionId?
